Function:

A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks.
It is defined with a name, a parameter list (optional), and a code block that contains the instructions to be executed when the function is called.
Functions are used for code modularity and reusability. They allow you to encapsulate a piece of functionality so that it can be called and reused multiple times from different parts of your program.
Functions are like blueprints or templates for performing a task; they define what should be done when invoked but do not execute their code until they are called.

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
Function Call:

A function call, on the other hand, is the act of executing or invoking a function. When you call a function, you are instructing the program to execute the code inside that function.
A function call consists of the function's name followed by parentheses, and you may provide arguments (values or expressions) inside the parentheses, if the function expects them.

message = greet("Alice")
